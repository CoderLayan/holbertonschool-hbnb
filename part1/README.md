# HBnB Evolution 

A modular backend design for a property listing and booking platform, similar to AirBnB. This architecture separates concerns into three layers: Presentation, Business Logic, and Persistence. The system supports operations such as user registration, place creation, review submission, and amenity management.
##  High-Level Architecture
 ### Layer Responsibilities
  1. Presentation Layer (API): Handles HTTP requests/responses. Forwards calls to the business logic.
E.g., POST /users ‚Üí User.create().

  2. Business Logic Layer (Models): Core domain logic: validation, transformations, and decision-making.

  3. Persistence Layer (Repositories): Handles database operations. Acts as an interface to the storage layer.
##  Business Logic Layer

This layer defines core domain entities and enforces business rules:

- **User**  
  Can register, authenticate, own places, and write reviews. Can be a regular user or admin.

- **Place**  
  Represents a rental listing. Includes amenities and reviews. Owned by a user.

- **Review**  
  Linked to a user and a place. Includes rating and feedback. Validates against duplicate or self-reviews.

- **Amenity**  
  Represents features such as Wi-Fi, air conditioning, etc. Can be linked to multiple places.

These models are designed with extensibility and data consistency in mind.

3. Modular design (easily testable and extensible)
4. UUID identifiers and timestamp tracking for all entities
5. Supports CRUD operations for Users, Places, Reviews, and Amenities
